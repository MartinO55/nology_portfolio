            "Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Martin and I am an
            aspiring web developer and software engineer, chasing my passion for
            design, coding and software development. I have a wide variety of
            experience in many different subjects and a proven track record of
            academic achievement in a wide variety of fields, including
            cybersecurity and fullstack web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I've worked on a variety of projects, from
            small business websites to large-scale enterprise software. I have a
            passion for creating high-quality, user-friendly, and efficient
            solutions that meet my clients' needs and exceed their expectations.
            In addition to my technical skills, I'm also a great communicator
            and problem-solver, and I enjoy working with clients to understand
            their goals and challenges and coming up with creative solutions to
            help them achieve success.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me painting, cooking, downhill
            skiing or doing tabletop gaming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio. If you have
            any questions or would like to discuss a potential project, please
            don't hesitate to contact me."

              This was the first game I built and published with the Unity
              Engine (and it shows), with the goal of gaining some experience
              with as much of the game development pipeline as possible. I did
              all of the programming, 3D modelling, rigging and animating
              myself; in fact the only thing I didn't do was the sound
              composition! Unfortunately, this was before I discovered Git and
              github, so there is no history or source code available, but I
              have uploaded the completed .apk file to github for you to
              download. It should run on any android device.
