# Portfolio for Nology

## Welcome to My Web Development Portfolio

This portfolio serves as a showcase of my web development skills and projects. It contains a selection of projects I have built in the past, as well as an overview of my experience and qualifications.

I have been working as a web developer for the past two years, and have experience with a variety of technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and more. I have worked on a wide range of projects, from simple websites to complex web applications.

In this portfolio, you will find a selection of projects I have worked on. Each project includes a detailed description of the project, screenshots, and a link to the live version.

In addition, I have included information about my qualifications and experience, as well as contact information for any questions or inquiries.

Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and create something amazing.

Sincerely,

Martin Olson

- You are to use SCSS for styling.
- !!! Responsiveness is vital â€“ use Grid, Flex, whatever you wish but the site must look good on mobile phones.
  VERY CRITICAL! : You will need to make sure that your website looks good on phones, tablets and laptops (use media queries for at least checking whether the device is a mobile phone)

Your Portfolio should have the following section:

- A landing page/section with your name and title on it.
- An About page/section with a little bit about you
- A Tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs you have learned during the course
- A Project page/section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo (using a README.md at the root of the repo to include how you went about coding for that project)
- A Contact page/section with your email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link

## About

This is the beta version of my portfolio, short several portfolio projects and some polish on the wording of different sections. The project was built entirely in HTML and CSS, with SCSS used to handle the styling, and the hosting done on Github Pages. The CSS layout is done entirely with flex in order to make the design more responsive on various screen sizes, with different media breakpoints for tablets and phones. The site is built as a single page, with different sections tagged with appropriate id's to allow the links to jump to them. The gradient background is actually generated entirely with SCSS styling used to create triangles of appropriate colour, then translating them into position at the top of the screen and setting them on descending Z-indexes, allowing them to be tapped individually for animation or recoloring at a later date. They can also be resized directly for different screen sizes in the media breakpoints, meaning the background keeps the desired design regardless of screen size or resolution.

The various icons were sourced from <https://fontawesome.com/icons> and <https://icons8.com/>, except for the 'spring' icon, which had to be sources from google images as neither of these sites had an option for this one. this tech stack is partially aspirational at curent, with several of the technologies not scheduled until later in the course.

Currently the portfolio section has two projects in it, a live marketplace website and an android unity game, along with placeholder slots for several more.

In the contect section you can find links to github, linkedIn, an email link and a resume for download.
